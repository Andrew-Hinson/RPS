After looking at a bunch of the other submissions in the Odin project, everyone was using these huge run on If/Else statements incorporating && || as well. To me, it didn't read very well and looked really tedious. So I set out to try to find a way around that logic and this is the best I could come up with so far by using an object and updating the object and using simple numerical > or < to figure out the winner.
I will need to add a game counter of who the winner is.
Styling is not amazing but I admit I'm weak in that regard.
