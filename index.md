## Andrew's Projects
My main goals are to showcase projects in a quick fasion here, and then to publish them on my own portfolio site as well.
This way, people can easily get a quick idea of what I've made, and can go further on my portfolio site if they wish.






```For now the only project that I'd want to showcase is my Odin project "RPS"-rock paper sissors. I'm proud of it for several reasons.
1. It was not a code-along.
2. I spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow and googling issues I came across.
3. The code looks nice and orderly with minimal commenting needed.

My main goals as a junior developer are to write clean and neat code, and to basically DRY.
Thanks for stopping by!
